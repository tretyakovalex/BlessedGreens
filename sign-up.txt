Here is a brief outline of how you can set up a sign-up form using Angular as the front-end and Node.js as the back-end:

Front-end:

   1. Use Angular to create a form with fields for user information such as name, email, password, etc.
   2. Implement form validation to ensure that all fields are filled correctly.
   3. Use Angular's HttpClient module to make a POST request to the back-end to send the user information.

Back-end:

   1. Set up a Node.js server using a framework such as Express.
   2. Define a REST API endpoint for handling sign-up requests from the front-end.
   3. Use a database (such as MongoDB) to store the user information.
   4. Implement server-side validation to ensure that the user information is correct.
   5. Hash the password before storing it in the database to ensure its security.
